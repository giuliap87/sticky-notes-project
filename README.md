# Sticky notes app

Sticky notes manager app.

## Description

With this app you can create, format, save and delete your sticky notes. 

Notes can be sorted chronologically. 

## Motivation

I created this project to practice my React and Redux skills, as well as getting used to workflow with git.

## How to run the project on your local machine

Clone repo, install node modules (npm install or yarn install) and start app (npm start or yarn start).

## How to use it

Create a note by entering text into the input box. You can format your text using the toolbar to bold, italicize, add links and bulletpoints. You can style the text as paragraph or headings. Add the note by clicking the green plus symbol. Notes are displayed with the date and time of their posting and can be modified by using the edit icon or deleted with the trash icon. You can sort your notes chronologically by using the select menu at the top of the page. 

## TODOS

- implement drag and drop
- save notes to local storage 
- improve design with material ui
- eventually create database to save notes
